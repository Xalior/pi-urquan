// kernel.cpp — brings the board up, then hands control to The Ur-Quan
// Masters.
//
// The game is an ordinary command-line program: it expects a working
// standard library, a filesystem holding its content packages, and an SDL2
// implementation. This file supplies the first two and starts the third,
// then calls the game's entry point with a fixed argument list.
//
// EVERYTHING THIS GAME TOUCHES LIVES IN ONE DIRECTORY ON THE CARD,
// RAPI_GAME_DIR, which the host Makefile sets and nothing upstream knows
// about. One card carries several games, and two of them writing a settings
// file into the card's root would each silently overwrite the other's.
//
// Four things point at it, and between them they cover every path the game
// can reach:
//
//   argv[0]        an absolute path inside it.
//   --contentdir   where the content packages are. Named explicitly rather
//                  than left to the engine's search, which otherwise tries
//                  the compiled-in path, then the working directory, then
//                  "content", and reports only that it found nothing.
//   --configdir    where the settings, the save games and the melee teams
//                  are written. This is the one directory the game writes
//                  to, so it is the one that has to be on writable media.
//   chdir          this kernel enters RAPI_GAME_DIR before the game starts,
//                  so anything opened by a relative name lands there too
//                  rather than in the card's root.
//
// This kernel also decides the core layout (see kernel.h for the roles) and
// hands one core to the shim's presentation worker. The library never starts
// a core; electing one is the host's job, and this is where it happens. The
// game itself knows none of it: it calls plain SDL, and its file access
// reaches the marshalled I/O service through the syscall layer in
// circle_syscalls.cpp.
