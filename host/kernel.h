//
// kernel.h — the Circle kernel that hosts The Ur-Quan Masters.
//
// Device ownership: this kernel brings up interrupts, the timer, a serial
// console carrying stdio, the SD card (FatFs, holding the content packages,
// the configuration and the save games) and the cooperative scheduler.
// Video, USB input and audio belong to circle-libsdl2 and are created inside
// SDL_Init when the game calls it. So do the CPU clock and the case fan,
// which the shim manages for its host; this kernel only says when they come
// up.
//
// Core roles, and the reason there are three of them:
//
//   core 0   the HARDWARE core. Circle's world lives here — scheduler,
//            interrupts, USB, the SD card, sound — and by construction no
//            other core may touch a device at all. It also runs the shim's
//            servo, which answers the other cores' marshalled calls.
//   core 1   the APPLICATION core. The game, alone. The Ur-Quan Masters is
//            internally multi-threaded and creates its threads through
//            SDL, so they are the shim's threads and all of them live on
//            this one core. Every platform call any of them makes is
//            marshalled back to core 0 by the shim.
//   core 2   the elected PRESENTATION core. It consumes the shim's frame
//            mailbox: scale, compose, present. Electing it is this
//            kernel's decision, not the library's — the library never
//            starts a core.
//   core 3   parked.
