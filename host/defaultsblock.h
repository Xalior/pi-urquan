//
// defaultsblock.h — the patchable-defaults block: a SHARED ABI, copied here.
//
// PROVENANCE. This file originates in the rapi-bootloader project, as
// rapi-bootloader/defaultsblock/defaultsblock.h, where it is also consumed
// by pi-mame and pi-cannonball. It is reproduced here byte-compatibly so this kernel can be
// stamped by the same network loader.
//
// IT IS AN INTERFACE, NOT OUR CODE. The network loader writes these bytes
// into a pushed kernel image blindly, at a fixed offset, without knowing
// which project the image belongs to. Every producer and every consumer
// must agree on the layout to the byte. Change anything here — the magic,
// the field order, the widths, the offset — and the loader will keep
// stamping images that no longer parse, for one consumer only, with no
// error anywhere. If the ABI genuinely needs to change, it changes at its
// origin and every consumer is updated together.
//
// The magic spells the name of the project that first defined the block.
// That is history, not ownership; it is part of the byte layout and stays.
//
// WHAT THIS KERNEL DOES WITH IT: see defaults.cpp. The block ships empty,
// and an empty block appends nothing, so an unstamped image boots exactly
// as it would if none of this existed.
