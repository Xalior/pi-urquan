# toolchain.mk — find the Arm GNU aarch64-none-elf cross toolchain, and the
# GNU tools circle-stdlib's configure needs on macOS.
#
# Include this at the top of any Makefile that compiles for the Pi.
#
# The cross compiler is looked for on PATH first, so a machine that already
# has it installed (a stranger's, a CI runner's) is left alone. Failing that,
# two places are searched, in order:
#
#   $RAPI_TOOLCHAIN_DIR — set it when the toolchain lives somewhere else
#                         entirely, which is the case for anyone consuming
#                         this repository from outside it.
#   toolchains/         — a copy unpacked into this repository.
#
# Either may be the unpacked toolchain itself or a directory holding one or
# more unpacked releases:
#
#   <dir>/arm-gnu-toolchain-<release>-aarch64-none-elf/bin/
#   <dir>/bin/
#
# That directory is not tracked in git — it holds a couple of gigabytes of
# vendor binaries. Download release 15.2.Rel1 for the aarch64-none-elf
# target, matching the machine you build ON, from
# https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads and
# unpack it there, or put its bin/ on your PATH. A symbolic link to a copy
# unpacked elsewhere works just as well.
#
# Build from the repository root — `make rpi5`, not `make -C host`. macOS
# ships GNU make 3.81, which passes a makefile's exported variables to its
# recipes but NOT to the $(shell ...) function. Circle's Rules.mk finds the
# compiler's support objects with $(shell $(CPP) -print-file-name=...), so
# in a make started without the toolchain already in its environment those
# lookups come back empty while every compile succeeds — and the failure
# surfaces much later as the linker reporting it "cannot find" a file with
# no name. Running from the root avoids it: the PATH exported here reaches
# the sub-make as an ordinary environment variable, because the sub-make is
# started from a recipe.
