# The three boards never share mutable state: each has its own circle-stdlib
# world, its own shim archive and its own object directory, so building them
# at the same time is safe and building one never disturbs another.
#
# The libc++ sources every world is built from are one immutable git tag, and
# CIRCLE_LLVM says where that checkout lives. The default puts it beside this
# repository, which is right for a plain clone and for a CI runner. Point
# several projects at one directory to fetch it once for all of them:
#
#   make deps CIRCLE_LLVM=/path/to/circle-llvm
